Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations in the
MongoDB Java Driver. 

To perform a single create, replace, update, or delete operation, you can use
the corresponding method. For example, to insert one document and replace one 
document, you can use the ``insertOne()`` and ``replaceOne()`` methods. In this
case, the ``MongoClient`` makes a call to the database for each operation. 

Generally, you can reduce the number of calls to the database by using bulk write 
operations. You can perform bulk write operations at the following levels:

- :ref:`Collection Level <java-sync-coll-bulk-write>`: You can use the 
  ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk write operations on a 
  single collection. This method groups write operations together by the kind
  of operation. For example, ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` puts multiple update
  operations in the same call, but makes two calls to the database for an insert
  operation and a replace operation.

- :ref:`Client Level <java-sync-client-bulk-write>`: When running {+mdb-server+} 
  version 8.0 or later, you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to perform 
  bulk write operations on multiple collections and databases in the same cluster.
  This method groups multiple kinds of write operations into one call.

.. _java-sync-coll-bulk-write:

Collection Bulk Write
---------------------

Bulk operations consist of many write operations. To perform a bulk operation 
at the collection level, pass a ``List`` of ``WriteModel`` documents to the 
``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method. A ``WriteModel`` is a model that 
represents any of the write operations. 

The ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method splits operations of different kinds into
different batches. For example, when you pass ``DeleteOneModel``, 
``DeleteManyModel``, and ``ReplaceOneModel`` operations to the method, the method
splits the delete operations into one batch and the replace operation 
into another. During this process, the client might reorder operations for 
efficiency if the bulk operation is not ordered.

The following sections show how to create and use each ``WriteModel``
document. The examples in each section use the following documents in the
``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "name": "Karen Sandoval", "age": 31 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "William Chin", "age": 54 }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#bulkWrite(java.util.List,com.mongodb.client.model.BulkWriteOptions)>`__
- `WriteModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/WriteModel.html>`__
- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__

Insert Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, you must
create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``InsertOneModel`` for two documents
describing people:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end insertDocumentsExample

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. Instead, the method throws a ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

   The following example tries to insert two documents where the ``_id`` is
   ``1`` and ``3``:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin insertExceptionExample
      :end-before: end insertExceptionExample

   The following shows the output of the preceding code:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :copyable: false

      A MongoBulkWriteException occurred with the following message: 
      Bulk write operation error on server sample-shard-00-02.pw0q4.mongodb.net:27017. 
      Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key 
      error collection: crudOps.bulkWrite index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }', details={}}].

   To see why the document with the ``_id`` of ``3`` didn't insert, see
   the :ref:`Order of Execution <orderOfExecution>` section.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the `InsertOneModel
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/InsertOneModel.html>`__
API documentation. 

Replace Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying
a query filter for the document you want to replace with the replacement
document. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``ReplaceOneModel`` cannot
   make changes to a document that violate unique index constraints on
   the collection, and the model does not replace a document if there
   are no matches to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to
replace a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a document that
contains an added ``location`` field: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin replaceDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end replaceDocumentsExample

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `ReplaceOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOneModel.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`Unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or an
``UpdateManyModel`` specifying a query filter for documents you want to
update with what the updates are.

The ``UpdateOneModel`` updates the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all the documents that
match your query filter. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``UpdateOneModel`` and
   ``UpdateManyModel`` cannot make changes to a document that violate
   unique index constraints on the collection, and the models do not
   update any documents if there are no matches to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to update
the ``age`` field in a document where the ``_id`` is ``2``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin updateDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end updateDocumentsExample

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `UpdateOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOneModel.html>`__ API documentation
- `UpdateManyModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateManyModel.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Delete Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or a
``DeleteManyModel`` specifying a query filter for documents you want to
delete. 

The ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all the documents that
match your query filter. 

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``DeleteOneModel`` and
   ``DeleteManyModel`` do not delete any documents if there are no matches
   to your query filter. 

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``DeleteOneModel`` to delete
a document where the ``_id`` is ``1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin deleteDocumentsExample
   :end-before: end deleteDocumentsExample

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `DeleteOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteOneModel.html>`__
- `DeleteManyModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteManyModel.html>`__

.. _orderOfExecution:

Order of Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts an optional ``BulkWriteOptions`` as a
second parameter to specify whether the execution of the bulk operations is
ordered or unordered.

Ordered Execution
+++++++++++++++++

By default, the ``bulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order. This means that the bulk operations execute in the order you
added them to the list until an error occurs, if any. 

Example 
```````

The following example performs these bulk operations:

- An operation that inserts a document with a ``name`` value of ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and an
  ``age`` value of ``37``
- An operation that replaces the document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a new document
  that contains the ``location`` field
- An operation that updates the document with a ``name`` value of ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and
  changes the ``name`` to ``"Zaynab Hassan"``
- An operation that deletes all documents where the ``age`` value is greater than ``50``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulkWriteExample
   :end-before: end bulkWriteExample

After running this example, your collection contains the following 
document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
   { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Hassan", "age": 37 }

Unordered Execution
+++++++++++++++++++

You can also execute bulk operations in any order by specifying "false"
to the ``order()`` method on ``BulkWriteOptions``. This means that
all the write operations execute regardless of errors and if any errors occur
the bulk operation reports them at the end. 

Adding to the preceding example, including the following specifies the bulk
operations to execute in any order: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/BulkWrite.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulkWriteNotOrderedExample
   :end-before: end bulkWriteNotOrderedExample

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution. The
   order can differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.
   
   In the preceding example, if the ``bulkWrite()`` method decided to
   perform the insert operation after the update operation, nothing
   changes with the update operation because the document does not exist
   at that point in time. Your collection then contains the following
   documents: 
   
   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
   
      { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
      { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
      { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Omar", "age": 37 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__
- `ordered() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html#ordered(boolean)>`__

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write:

Client Bulk Write
-----------------

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later,
you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to write
to multiple databases and collections in the same cluster. The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
method does not split different kinds of operations into different batches.

In the examples in preceding sections of this page, the ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method 
takes a list of ``WriteModel`` instances in which the specified subclass of 
``WriteModel`` represents the corresponding write operation. For example, an
instance of ``InsertOneModel`` represents an operation to insert one document. 

Similarly, the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method takes a 
list of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances to represent different write operations.
For example, an instance of ``ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel`` represents an
operation to insert one document.

You can construct instances of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` using the following
methods:

- ``insertOne()``

- ``updateOne()``

- ``updateMany()``

- ``replaceOne()``

- ``deleteOne()``

- ``deleteMany()``

These methods are used to construct corresponding write models. 
For example, ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel.updateOne()`` is used to
construct a ``ClientNamespacedUpdateOneModel`` instance, which represents an
update operation.

These methods take a ``MongoNamespace`` object that defines which
database and collection to write to. Some, such as ``insertOne()``, can take a 
``Document`` instance that defines information about the write operation. 
Some other methods, such as ``updateOne()`` and ``replaceOne()``, take a filter 
object that defines the subset of documents to be updated or replaced.

The following sections provide examples of how to use the client ``bulkWrite()`` 
method.

Insert Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to insert 
two documents. One document is inserted into the ``db.people`` collection, while
the other document is inserted into the ``db.things`` collection. 
The ``MongoNamespace`` instance defines the databases and collections that 
each write operation applies to.

.. code-block:: java

   MongoNamespace peopleNamespace = new MongoNamespace("db", "people");
   MongoNamespace thingsNamespace = new MongoNamespace("db", "things");

   List<ClientNamespacedWriteModel> bulkOperations = new ArrayList<>();

   ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel insertDocument1 = new ClientNamespacedWriteModel
      .insertOne(
         peopleNamespace, 
         new Document("name", "Julia Smith")
      );

   ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel insertDocument2 = new ClientNamespacedWriteModel
      .insertOne(
         thingsNamespace, 
         new Document("object", "washing machine")
      );

   bulkOperations.add(insertDocument1);
   bulkOperations.add(insertDocument2);

   ClientBulkWriteResult result = mongoClient.bulkWrite(bulkOperations);

.. TODO: link documentation

Replace Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to replace
existing documents in the ``db.people`` and ``db.things`` collections.

.. code-block:: java

   MongoNamespace peopleNamespace = new MongoNamespace("db", "people");
   MongoNamespace thingsNamespace = new MongoNamespace("db", "things");

   List<ClientNamespacedWriteModel> bulkOperations = new ArrayList<>();

   bulkOperations.add(ClientNamespacedWriteModel.replaceOne(
         peopleNamespace, 
         Filters.eq("_id", 1),
         new Document("name", "Frederic Hilbert")
      )
   );

   bulkOperations.add(ClientNamespacedWriteModel.replaceOne(
         thingsNamespace, 
         Filters.eq("_id", 1),
         new Document("object", "potato")
      )
   );

   ClientBulkWriteResult result = mongoClient.bulkWrite(bulkOperations);

After this example runs successfully, the document that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
in the ``people`` collection is replaced with a new document. The document in 
the ``things`` collection that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
is replaced with a new document.

.. _java-sync-client-bulk-write-options:

Bulk Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass an instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` to the ``bulkWrite()``
method to specify options when running the bulk write operations.

Order of Execution Example
``````````````````````````

By default, the individual operations in a bulk operation are executed in the
order that you specify them until an error occurs, or until they execute 
successfully. However, you can pass ``false`` to the ``ordered()`` method on 
the ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` interface to perform write operations in an 
unordered way. When using the unordered option, an error-producing operation 
does not prevent execution of other write operations in the call to the 
``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following code sets the ``ordered()`` method on an
instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` and performs a bulk write operation to 
insert multiple documents.

.. code-block:: java

   MongoNamespace namespace = new MongoNamespace("db", "people");

   ClientBulkWriteOptions options = new ClientBulkWriteOptions().ordered(false);

   List<ClientNamespacedWriteModel> bulkOperations = new ArrayList<>();

   bulkOperations.add(
      ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne(
         namespace, 
         new Document("_id", 1).append("name", "Rudra Suraj")
      )
   );
   
   // Causes a duplicate key error
   bulkOperations.add(
      ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne(
         namespace, 
         new Document("_id", 1).append("name", "Mario Bianchi")
      )
   );

   bulkOperations.add(
      ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne(
         namespace, 
         new Document("name", "Wendy Zhang")
      )
   );

   ClientBulkWriteResult result = mongoClient.bulkWrite(bulkOperations, options);

Even though the write operation inserting a document with a duplicate key results
in an error, the other operations are executed because the write operation is
unordered.

Summary
-------

``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk operation, you create and pass a list of
``WriteModel`` instances to the ``bulkWrite()`` method. 

There are 6 different ``WriteModel`` subtypes: ``InsertOneModel``,
``ReplaceOneModel``, ``UpdateOneModel``, ``UpdateManyModel``,
``DeleteOneModel`` and ``DeleteManyModel``. 

There are two ways to execute the ``bulkWrite()`` method: 

- Ordered, which performs the bulk operations in order until an error occurs, if any
- Unordered, which performs all the bulk operations in any order and reports errors
  at the end, if any

``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 or later, you 
can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk operations on multiple 
databases and collections at once.

To perform a client bulk operation, you create an pass a list of 
``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances to this method.

There are six subtypes of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` that are used to
represent write operations. To construct these write models, you can use the
corresponding ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` methods ``insertOne()``, ``updateOne()``, 
``updateMany()``, ``replaceOne()``, ``deleteOne()``, and ``deleteMany()``. These 
methods take a ``MongoNamespace`` object that defines which
database and collection to write to.

The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method can also take a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions``
object to specify different options for how the command is executed.

To learn more about the client ``bulkWrite`` command, see the 
:manual:`bulkWrite() <reference/command/bulkWrite/>` method reference in the {+mdb-server+}
Manual.
